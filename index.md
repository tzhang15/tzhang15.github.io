## About

I’m a 4th-year chemistry PhD student at University of Washington Theberge lab. I’m working on developing microfluidic devices to understand cell signaling mechanisms underlying human diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and pulmonary fibrosis in asthma.

I graduated with a BA in chemistry from Cornell College in 2015. While at Cornell, my research focused on organic synthesis for solvatochromic dyes (solutes that change colors when dissolved in solvents with different polarities). I also interned at Integrated DNA Technologies as a quality control scientist.

## Misc

I’m an adventurer always willing to explore new things and visit different places. I enjoy learning French, aerial yoga, baking and wine tasting. I wish to learn everything about La Dégustation de Vin and La Pâtisserie. Check them out [here](./research.html)!
